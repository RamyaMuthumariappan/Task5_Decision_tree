In this code I have created a decision tree using Random forest algorithm, and I have used heart disease data from Kaggle. 
There are few steps to be followed to create a decision tree 
Import scikit learn, matplotlib and pandas library.
Load the dataset
Feature matrix x and label y
Split data into train and test 
To train decision tree with default depth there are two steps to be followed:
Visualize the tree 
Evaluate accuracy
Analyze overfitting - Ny controlling the depth of the tree the overfitting can be analyzed accurately.
Train a randomforest and compare the accuracy.
Interpret feature importance from Random forest
Evaluating the Random forest using cross validation.
